            <p>
              In the face of climate change and the dawn of the Anthropocene, we
              as humans are constantly challenged to reflect on our impact over
              our planet and to perceive the interconnections among the many
              forms of life that inhabit it. Recently, ideas such as the concept
              of hyperobject, defined by philosopher Timothy Morton as an entity
              that is challenging to visualize due to its scale (whether too
              large or too small, or both) have shed light on the need to
              transcend the narrow human scale to counteract the climate crisis.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Macromicroscopio</strong> is an art installation project
              that provokes us to readjust our gaze and expand it across
              different temporal and spatial scales through data visualization.
              Drawing from biodiversity data within the
              <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living Planet Index</a>
              database we visualize the population numbers of different species
              that cohabit this planet over time, while simultaneously
              displaying
              <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA's</a> surface
              temperature anomaly data from 1950 to 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through the representation of entire populations of animal species
              as animated points with random movements, we allude to the imagery
              of petri dishes — symbols of the unseen small, now utilized to
              visualize the vastness that eludes our immediate perception.
              Concurrently, by visualizing the temperature data through the
              color tonality of the image, we metaphorically portray an
              environment under warming conditions where diverse life forms are
              affected by human impact.
            </p>

            <img src="site/assets/what2.png" height="295" width="575" />

            <p>
              While the project invites viewers to expand their spatial scale
              perception through the petri dish metaphor, the extended duration
              of the animation encourages temporal scale dilation. We invite
              spectators to immerse in the hypnotic motion, to observe the loss
              in biodiversity over the years, and to ponder the potential
              correlations between the many data points visualized.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this experience, we hope spectators may lose sight of the
              gradual and subtle shifts in hue — the transformation from cool
              blues to intense fiery reds that denote the slow-burning process
              of climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, we employ data visualization, a critical technology for
              diagnosing the climate crisis, not to communicate immediate
              decision-making data but to challenge our perception of our place
              on the planet, the impacts of our actions, and to suggest an
              understanding of ecological entanglement among life forms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Macromicroscopio</strong> aims to ignite a deepened
              awareness of the interconnectedness of living creatures in our
              ecosystem, to inspire reflection and promote a greater
              understanding of the profound effects of our actions on the world
              around us and the role data visualization may play in this
              scenario.
